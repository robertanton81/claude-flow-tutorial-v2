## üöÄ Generated Commands

### Basic E-commerce (Beginner)
```bash
# For: Small product catalog (< 100 items), simple checkout
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc tdd "Build ${APP_NAME} e-commerce store for ${PRIMARY_PRODUCTS} targeting ${TARGET_CUSTOMERS} with basic product catalog, shopping cart, ${PAYMENT_PROVIDERS} checkout, and admin panel using ${FRONTEND_TECH} and ${DATABASE}"

# Example:
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc tdd "Build ArtisanMarket e-commerce store for handmade items targeting creative consumers with basic product catalog, shopping cart, Stripe checkout, and admin panel using React and PostgreSQL"
```

### Advanced E-commerce (Intermediate)
```bash
# For: Medium catalog (100-1000 items), user accounts, reviews
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc tdd "Build ${APP_NAME} e-commerce platform for ${PRIMARY_PRODUCTS} targeting ${TARGET_CUSTOMERS} with user authentication, product search/filters, reviews/ratings, wishlist, order tracking, ${PAYMENT_PROVIDERS} payments, inventory management, and responsive design using ${FRONTEND_TECH}, ${BACKEND_TECH}, and ${DATABASE}"

# Example:
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc tdd "Build TechHub e-commerce platform for electronics targeting tech enthusiasts with user authentication, product search/filters, reviews/ratings, wishlist, order tracking, Stripe payments, inventory management, and responsive design using Next.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL"
```

### Enterprise E-commerce (Advanced)
```bash
# For: Large catalog (1000+ items), multi-vendor, analytics
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc tdd "Build ${APP_NAME} enterprise e-commerce marketplace for ${PRIMARY_PRODUCTS} targeting ${TARGET_CUSTOMERS} with multi-vendor support, advanced search/AI recommendations, real-time inventory, subscription products, multi-currency, analytics dashboard, SEO optimization, performance monitoring, automated testing, CI/CD pipeline, and ${HOSTING_PREFERENCE} deployment using ${FRONTEND_TECH}, ${BACKEND_TECH}, ${DATABASE}, and microservices architecture"

# Example:
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc tdd "Build GlobalMarket enterprise e-commerce marketplace for fashion targeting young professionals with multi-vendor support, advanced search/AI recommendations, real-time inventory, subscription products, multi-currency, analytics dashboard, SEO optimization, performance monitoring, automated testing, CI/CD pipeline, and AWS deployment using Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and microservices architecture"
```
