- Authentication + Authorization + User Management
- Real-time Features + WebSockets + Message Queues
- Analytics + Monitoring + Alerting
- File Upload + Processing + Storage
- Search + Indexing + Caching

### Architecture Patterns
Choose patterns based on requirements:
- **Monolithic**: Simple applications, small teams
- **Modular Monolith**: Medium complexity, clear boundaries
- **Microservices**: High complexity, large teams
- **Serverless**: Event-driven, cost-sensitive
- **JAMstack**: Content-focused, performance-critical
